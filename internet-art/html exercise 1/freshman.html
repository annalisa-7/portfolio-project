        When we experience the Earth as holy ... our actions may change from control and destruction of the Earth, to living in respect for and communion with the Earth. Without air, water, soil, vegetation, there's no human life ... the Earth is literally our body.

        But if you can't think of an observation that could disprove a theory, that theory simply isn't scientific.

        Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, and not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science.

        When we reflected that this is not a solitary phenomenon, never to happen again, but that it would happen forever and ever an infinite number of evenings, and cheer and reassure the latest child that walked there, it was more glorious still.

        How glorious a greeting the sun gives the mountains! To behold this alone is worth the pains of any excursion a thousand times over. The highest peaks burned like islands in a sea of liquid shade.

        Humanity can never fully know what it is about; for the reasoning mind gains insight into one reality only by casting shadows upon another.

        After sleeping through a hundred million centuries we have finally opened our eyes on a sumptuous planet, sparkling with color, bountiful with life. Within decades we must close our eyes again. Isn't it a noble, an enlightened way of spending our brief time in the sun, to work at understanding the universe and how we have come to wake up in it? This is how I answer when I am asked -- as I am surprisingly often -- why I bother to get up in the mornings.

        Nobody lies awake worrying about gaps in the fossil record. Many people lie awake worrying about abortion and drugs and the decline of the family and gay marriage and all of the other things that are opposed to so-called 'moral values.'

        I posit that there is no distinguishing between times I am glad not to remember and times that could only be as good as they were at the cost of retaining any memory.

        Don't try to change the world. Find something that you love, and do it every day. Do that for the rest of your life and eventually the world will change.

        He wants all things to be able to recognise all creatures (even himself) as glorious and excellent things. He wants to kill their self-love as soon as possible: but it is His long-term policy, I fear, to retire them to a new kind of self-love -- a charity and gratitude for all selves, including their own; when they have really learned to love their neighbors as themselves, they will be allowed to love themselves as their neighbors.

        In a word, the Future is, of all things, the thing <i>least like</i> eternity. It is the most completely temporal part of time -- for the Past is frozen and no longer flows, and the Present is all lit up with eternal rays.

        We have trained them to think of the Future as a promised land which favoured heroes attain -- not as something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour, whatever he does, whoever he is.

        Here's a crazy idea, let them live until they die of old age. Is there any crueler a punishment than life itself and all the drama and little toe-stubbing-into-door-frame there is?

        You scroll through your phone contacts in your moment of deepest need and believe that there isn't a single person who would help you without resenting you. At that moment you feel as if you've been lying to yourself all along about how much you matter.

        After feeling like I am just being dragged by time through life rather than actually being able to participate in it, my greatest desire is that if I lie down and stop moving, that maybe I will just cease to exist.
