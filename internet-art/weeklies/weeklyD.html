    This week, I began my portfolio website. I think the thing that surprised me the most was the amount of work that I spent on PhotoShop.
    I've never used PhotoShop before and didn't know it was that complicated. I learned that,
    to create my two images -- the foreground of the pot and the background -- I needed to
    create layers and mask selectively. I'm still a bit confused on it, so I'm going to have to
    watch some YouTube videos.
    <br><br>
    I'm glad I now have a template that I want to follow with my pots -- I know what I want it to look like:
    <div><img src="/images/pot1.png" width="30%" height="30%">
    <img src="/images/background1.png" width="30%" height="30%"></div>
    <h1>and finally</h1>
    I'm building my face for the homepage and it's not turning out how I envisioned it in my head.
    I might try to to make it more abstract, move the images around so it's not aligned just like
    a face would be. I think that might make it more interesting to look at than it is right now.
