    I'm writing this after the fact, but while I was brainstorming concepts for the 
    iteration exercise, I considered making a sky full of stars named after one of my 
    favorite songs, a field of mugs, a sea of chairs, or a sky of birds. 
    One interesting idea I had was to use iteration to draw the branches of a tree. 
    I was thinking, by varying the size of the branches, I could go for a fractal look. 
    While that could have been interesting, I decided it would be fun to play with 
    Perlin noise and make a wall of clocks. My final product was a little eery with 
    all of the clocks moving around like that, but I was happy with it! I'm excited to 
    learn some object-oriented programming to make it that I could automate the clocks 
    on the wall instead of writing each out.
