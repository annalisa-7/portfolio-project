    This week I finished my final project. I knew my overarching goal was to make 
    my html elements interact with my p5.js rendering. Overall, I was pleased with my 
    result although there are more kinks I could work out. I think I got the big issues 
    resolved, though, so I am satisfied with the final product.
    <br><br>
    I used code from an example on p5.js because it was a perfect example of what I wanted -- 
    balls bouncing off of each other. I didn't see the point to making it if it was already 
    made well. But of course, I added my own touches. I created a color palette that would 
    match the aesthetic of my art. Also I eliminated gravity and friction, and I made it 
    so the circles would bounce off of the walls. And of course, I made it so that the 
    circles would bounce off of the images.
    <br><br>
    I detailed in my documentation for the final the specific detailed issues I had with 
    getting the balls to bounce off of the images naturally.
