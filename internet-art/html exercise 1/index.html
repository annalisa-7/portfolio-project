        Over the last 5 years, I've collected various quotes and lyrics on my Notes app. Going through them today makes me realize how I've changed and how I've stayed the same. Some quotes still speak to me, while others have waned.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, I compile them for access. The question here is, which quotes speak to you? And what does that say about where you are in life? This exercise aims to answer that. Just answer the questions to find out.
