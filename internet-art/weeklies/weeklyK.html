    <h1>last reflection</h1>
    <h2>sad</h2>
    <p class="shadow">Reflecting back on this semester, I really didn't know what to expect when joining 
    this class. I took it for fun because it was my last semester but I really think 
    I learned valuable things from this class.
    <br><br>
    For one, I enjoyed the readings. They were more abstract than most pieces I read, 
    so it was a challenge for me. Still, I got a lot out of them. What I especially 
    liked was the readings on the natural "grain" of the internet/screens. Just like 
    plastic, screens will begin (and continue) as a skeuomorph, imitating properties of 
    existing tools, but by embracing its grain, one can achieve the greatest results.
    <br><br>
    I'm really proud of the progress I made in my coding skills. Before this class, I 
    had only ever coded in Python, and I'd used it for data analysis. The coding in 
    this class activated my practical problem solving skills and my creativity. I'm so proud 
    of my website and can't wait to give it out to people when I mention I do art. I'm 
    going to continue working on it long past this class.</p>
