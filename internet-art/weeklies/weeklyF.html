    When making my room for exercise 4, I had some issues. I made the room look 3d
    without using any of p5.js's 3d functionality. But when I tried to make the
    functionality 3d to add my tori and spheres, etc., my room that I had made
    did not maintain its look.

    <br><br>

    So I decided to keep my drawing in 2d, without using any 3d functionality. I'm kind
    of disappointed -- I wanted to try out my idea of jarring 3d-2d juxtaposition.

    <br><br>

    Where I'm at right now, I'm struggling to figure out what to do next. I've been in
    writer's block of sorts all day. I'm thinking (1) I could make my canvas stagnant,
    not being re-rendered so that the cursor becomes a marker, or (2) I could make
    some random shapes on the wall, or (3) I could make it so that when someone clicks
    on the walls they change color.
