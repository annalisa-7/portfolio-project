    I've been so busy lately that I haven't made any progress really at all with my 
    final project. But I do know that I would like there to be a p5.js rendering that 
    interacts with the buttons of my site. I could have balls bouncing off the buttons, 
    herding forming around the buttons, etc.

    I missed the class discussion on Imagined Communities, but I completed the reading 
    on the Content Industrial Complex. It was so interesting because I've never considered 
    the free advertising that already wealthy companies get through all of their hip 
    branding or pop-ups that are posted about on social media. Especially when they have 
    the power leverage over artists, they can choose to offer low bars of exchange, like 
    giving access to a broader client base (which costs them little to none to provide).

    When speaking abou the Yayoi Kusama infinity rooms, I remember having the same thought. 
    The value in the artwork was more in the posting of it on social media than just 
    being in the room. Having gone to the infinity rooms myself, I have always taken 
    a picture when in them, and naturally it's a selfie. It's hard for me to just appreciate 
    it, but I can understand how that changes what it means to be a successful artist today, 
    for better or for worse.
