    <h1>Weekly 1: 01/29/23</h1>
    <h3 class="shadow">This week, I spent a good deal of time (maybe more than I should have) on the two assignments -- the HTML link project
    and the Five Variations project. The HTML link project was inspired by an experience losing all of my saved quotes and
    lyrics from high school when I dropped my phone in the ocean. I typed each out (also an exercise in revisiting old thoughts)
    sorted them by year. Then, I decided to "gamify" it, making the quotes that the user identified with most say something
    about the person. For my Five Variations project, I tried to vary the poem in as many ways I could think of to facilitate
    different interpretations.</h3>
    <h3 class="background">I loved the readings from this week. I know that there was some argument for an almost "un-natural" computer experience.
    While I understand the sentiment (it's better for society, I believe, to not have people see Internet experiences as natural
    and replace real experiences and intuitions with digital), I don't think it's a web designer's job or incentiveto make people
    feel "un-natural" on their sites. I liked the concept of software as a skeuomorph and its natural "grain" as flux. That is its
    unique quality, and it's only logical for that to be the screen's appeal.</h3>
