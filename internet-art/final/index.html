    When considering which exercise to expand upon, I think I would 
    like to make a more dynamic iteration image. One idea I saw online 
    one time was to make a series of dots -- some that attract one another 
    and some that repel -- to make a living image. I would love to try 
    this idea, but I'd also like to embed it into my website. Right now, 
    I'm thinking it'd be fun to have buttons on my website that the 
    dots would interact with too, but the buttons would stay static.
