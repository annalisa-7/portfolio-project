    When considering which exercise to expand upon, I think I would 
    like to make a more dynamic iteration image. One idea I saw online 
    one time was to make a series of dots -- some that attract one another 
    and some that repel -- to make a living image. I would love to try 
    this idea, but I'd also like to embed it into my website. Right now, 
    I'm thinking it'd be fun to have buttons on my website that the 
    dots would interact with too, but the buttons would stay static.

    I found a book called <i>The Nature of Code</i> that helps with 
    creating the system I'm seeking. However, it's written for use with 
    the language Processing, which is more low-level than p5.js. So while 
    it can help me with general concepts of herding/flocking, I need 
    to ignore the sample code he provides because it will just confuse me.

    <b>Update:</b> So I figured out how to render a p5.js drawing behind 
    the elements of my html page. This was done by including the HTML elements 
    inside a div on my HTML page, then making that div be embedded in the 
    container holding the p5.js page. So far, I've just included a simple 
    p5.js rendering I found on the examples page of the p5.js website so I 
    can test that it worked. The rendering was of a circle, but the more 
    bubbly, cartoonish look I think actually works. I may go in that direction, 
    making several iterations of circle with different colors and sizes that 
    interact with each other and the HTML elements in simple ways. I might 
    have them attract to their nearest element or bounce off the elements.
