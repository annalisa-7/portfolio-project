        People who are fine with reality are not in touch with reality.

        If the library were to fall down right now, all the work that everybody had been doing would be worth nothing.

        What is more appropriate to our world than that which is beautiful?

        You didn't believe in heaven because you knew heaven was here on Earth. You saw it clearly and you helped others see it. It's all here. All we could ever wish for or need is all around us.

        The eggs of the mantis are secure in little cases of thin parchment attached to the branch of a shrub by the mother who lived her life span with the summer that is gone.

        If to be human is to be a thing in time shaped by other things in time -- a name on a birth certificate; the object of a dog's gaze; cremated ashes; a person who wants to love, though love seems small and out of place compared to plankton, viewed from space -- if this is what it means to be human, then our connection to the inhuman is intimate. We are all "entrances and exits"; <i>"we must be in / common,"</i> as the fetus says to her mother.

        If I were an artist I would make a life-size sculpture of a full-grown tree and make ppl realize they don't have to go see it its all around them and its beautiful

        Suspended between the nastiness of life and the meanness of the dead, she couldn't get interested in leaving life or living it, let alone the fright of the two creeping-off boys.

        Only 11 years old. RIP Elijah. I take so much of my life for granted and I've lived over twice the number of years you got. I'm gonna try harder!

        Peace I leave you;
        my peace I give you.
        I do not give to you as the world gives.
        Do not let your heart be troubled
        and do not be afraid. I am with you.

        Death is light by which the shadow of all of life's meaning is measured. Without death, everything would feel inconsequential, all experience arbitrary, all metrics and values suddenly zero.
